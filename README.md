# Welcome! My name is Vladimir Dinolov and I'm a Junior Data Scientist.
I'm also an education subject matter expert with a background in social impact. Data Science and Education are my passions. I have been working in data science and analytics for over 2 years. In my previous career, I was a high performing educator ranked in the top 1% of 10,000 teachers in the Dallas-Fort Worth Area. I was then given the title 'Master Teacher' by the Texas Education Agency Commissioner. My success in the classroom led me to apply that same work ethic to becoming a Data Scientist, receiving my M.S. in Applied Data Science. I use a blend of information management, statistics, and computer science techniques and tools like Python, R, SQL, and Tableau to analyze big data and create visualizations that drive impact.

# [Project 1: Erasing the Opportunity Gap in NYC Public Schools](https://github.com/vladimir-dinolov/NYDOE.git)
* Cleaned 1,272 rows and 161 columns of public education data
* Identified gaps in student academic achievement and Specialized High School Test registration by income and race.
* Designed 20+ visualizations using R Studio then edited in Adobe Illustrator for improved aesthetics.
* Created infographic in Adobe Illustrator persuading stakeholders to invest funds strategically by location and Economic Need Index (ENI).

# [Project 2: Optimizing Energy Outages to Minimize Costs and Maximize Revenue](https://github.com/vladimir-dinolov/Hydro.git)
* Conducted descriptive and predictive analyses with multiple modeling techniques including:
  * Association Rule Mining
  * Text Mining
  * K-means Clustering
  * Decision Trees
  * Naïve Bayes Algorithms
  * Support Vector Machines  
* Designed classifier to identify when the client should schedule outages to minimize waste and cos, potentially saving millions of dollars.  
* Employed machine learning to classify positive vs. negative outages, identifying a total of 85,500 outages and how much energy was conserved or lost due to each outage.

# [Project 3: Tracking User Behavior and Acquisition to Increase Pageviews](https://github.com/vladimir-dinolov/Google-Analytics.git)
* Created Google Analytics campaign and dashboard reports for Commit’s Tableau Gallery, which resulted in an increase of 2,100 users and 8,000 page views.
* Designed Google Data Studio dashboard to track historical usage and assisted in implementation of subpages curated to specific users. 


Due to company policy, the live dashboard cannot be shared as it is intended for internal use. However, a static version is below:
