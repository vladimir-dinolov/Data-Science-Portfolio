# Welcome! My name is Vladimir Dinolov and I'm a Junior Data Scientist.
I'm also an education subject matter expert with a background in social impact. Data Science and Education are my passions. I have been working in data science and analytics for over 2 years. In my previous career, I was a high performing educator ranked in the top 1% of 10,000 teachers in the Dallas-Fort Worth Area. I was then given the title 'Master Teacher' by the Texas Education Agency Commissioner. My success in the classroom led me to apply that same work ethic to becoming a Data Scientist, receiving my M.S. in Applied Data Science. I use a blend of information management, statistics, and computer science techniques and tools like Python, R, SQL, and Tableau to analyze big data and create visualizations that drive impact.

# [Project 1: Erasing the Opportunity Gap in NYC Public Schools](https://github.com/vladimir-dinolov/NYDOE.git)
* Cleaned 1,272 rows and 161 columns of public education data
* Identified gaps in student academic achievement and Specialized High School Test registration by income and race.
* Designed 20+ visualizations using R Studio then edited in Adobe Illustrator for improved aesthetics.
* Created infographic in Adobe Illustrator persuading stakeholders to invest funds strategically by location and Economic Need Index (ENI).

# [Project 2: Optimizing Energy Outages to Minimize Costs and Maximize Revenue](https://github.com/vladimir-dinolov/Hydro.git)
* Conducted descriptive and predictive analyses with multiple modeling techniques including:
  * Association Rule Mining
  * Text Mining
  * K-means Clustering
  * Decision Trees
  * Na√Øve Bayes Algorithms
  * Support Vector Machines  
* Designed classifier to identify when the client should schedule outages to minimize waste and cos, potentially saving millions of dollars.  
* Employed machine learning to classify positive vs. negative outages, identifying a total of 85,500 outages and how much energy was conserved or lost due to each outage.
